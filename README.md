# COVID-19 Time-Series Forecasting

This project performs time-series forecasting on COVID-19 data using the ARIMA model to predict future cases, deaths, and recoveries.

## Project Overview
- Data is cleaned, missing values are handled, and outliers are removed.
- ARIMA model is used for forecasting based on historical COVID-19 data.
- Visualizations are provided to show trends in COVID-19 cases, mortality and recovery ratios, and daily growth rates.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values and outliers.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes the data distributions and trends.
3. **Modeling**: ARIMA model is applied to forecast future COVID-19 cases.
4. **Evaluation**: RMSE is used to assess model accuracy.

## Results
- The ARIMA model provides reasonable forecasts for future COVID-19 cases based on past data.
